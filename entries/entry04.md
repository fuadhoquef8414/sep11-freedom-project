### Content
Currently me and My Partner Kyle have been have a lot of trail and error moements while making our Freedon Project. Me and Kyle have been 3d modeling the shoe on vectary,
however, we are having a problem in terms of collaborating. Vectary asks you to pay 12 dollars to invite members to join your workspace so that in itself was a big problem. However, the 3d model of the shoe is in the works and we have an MVP for it. 
We now have an idea of which types of shapes to use to create the shoe and we tested out what type of shapes will make the shoe look good. 

### EDP
As mentioned before our engineering desing process has all been through the website `vectary`. We have learned and visualized some greate shapes to help us with the shoe. 
Moving forward me and Kyle will be trying to go back to the `three.js` documentation to see if there is a much easier way to to build the model instead of using a differnt website. `three.js` works similar to how `p5js` 
is like so this could be very simple. 

### Skills
There are a lot of skills that me and Kyle have developed throughout the Freedom Proeject. One skill that me and Kyle been doing and we have to get better at to do our research on how well certain tools and websites can help with our project without using them. For example, vectary is great for making 3d models but it isn't good for team collabortation. Speaking of team collaboration, me and Kyle have been working on communication more due to the schedule changes where we don't see each other at all during our SEP period and any other class period.
