We have been working on the freedom project to create an MVP. The MVP is the minimum viable product. This means we don't have to have a full project finished
and completed but we must have something that functions. Me and Kyle were doing our research on how to create more than one shape in our scene. We came across `(shapename)Geometry`.
This was helpful to create more than one shape. Also you can customize the shape. We initially started off with a cube. Then we added a ball or a sphere. Also we added more shapes tried to add rotations to it. 
Our next step was to use our knowledge to make an MVP. We used the shapes in our scene and put them together to see if we can create an object. We were successfully able to make 
a mango looking object using certain shapes and colors. Although our 3d model doesn't look good it works. Now our finishing touches and what will make the project done is by taking our 3d shoe model and putting it into
the scene in three.js. 

# EDP
Me and Kyle designed a couple of shapes in our scene and it. We decided to use `(shapename)Geometry` to add more shapes and different types of shapes. We also have a full 3d model of a shoe done on `vectary.`
We are now currently working on using the shapes we put in our scene and trying to sculpt it into a shoe. We are currently working on a second way of doing this and it is by just importing our `vectary` to the scene.

## Trial and Error
It took us a very long time to figure out how to learn and understand how to create and build ONLY basic shapes. For a couple months me and Kyle have been mainly working on vectary to create a shoe model. However, one mistake me and Kyle made was spending too much of our time working on Vectary while being unsure if it was possible to to put it in three.js. Luckily, me and Kyle found out that it is possible to import and export the 3d model from vectary. 

## A-ha Moment
One a-ha moment we had this month was when we learned about loaders. In three.js there is loaders. These loaders render your 3d model. The loader that we used was called Draco Loader. However since we had a model that was more advance then just the cube I had an a-ha moment and realized that we need a GTLF loader instead. 


# Sources 
The sources we used is a the three.js documentary and a tutorial of how to use shapes on `vectary`. We also used many tutorials on youtube on how to export 3d models into `three.js`.
We used the `three.js` channel on `slack` to see if anyone has any suggestions on how to approach this task. The answer is yes it is possible to move 3d models from other websites to `three.js`.

# Skills 
Some skills we have learned is planning. We also learned how to create different types of shapes on `three.js`. Another skill that we have learned is the use of communicating with people who are more experienced. For instance, someone who used three.js for her freedom project previous years was very helpful for us to get our GTLF Loader fixed.
