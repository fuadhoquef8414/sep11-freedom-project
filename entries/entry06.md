### Content
Our Freedom Project has finally come to a closing. This freedom project came with a lot of learning experiences and trail and error. This year Me and Kyle 
decided to use three.js to make a model of a shoe. This was a very important project to us both because we both are very passionate about shoes and Kyle is a
sneaker reseller. Not only was this just a passion for us, we used techniques to help make our project entertaining for the audience. For our project we wanted to 
use a real world event that is happening right now, in our case our project tackles the trend of sneaker reselling. For our project we decided to create an ad of the shoe.
We thought that a shoe advertisement would be very helpful for the sneaker reseller business. 

#### The Timeline
In the beginnning of our project me and Kyle thought that making 3d models would be a very fun. We wanted something that would be fun and interactive when making it considering the fact that we will be doing this project throughout the whole year. During the project me and Kyle had a lot of trouble figuring out the basics of `three.js`. We didn´t know how to read documentation, we didn´t understand certains parts of the youtube tutorials that we were watching. In fact some of the videos that we watched were outdated and me and Kyle didn´t even realize. However, thanks to the three.js documentation we were finally able to make a cube. This was our first checkpoint during the timeline of the project. However, after making the cube we were still confused. We knew that we had to make a shoe but we were confused on how to construct it. We couldn´t figure out on to turn a cube into a shoe or at least how to code it into doing that. So when it was time to make an MVP, I understood that it has to be the minimum viable product. So me and Kyle decided to add a couple of shapes together to form an object. The reason we did this was to create a place holder object that does the same thing that our shoe will be doing. That was our MVP because it was minimum but it worked. But we still couldn´t create a shoe model yet and didn´t know how to put it into `three.js`. However, I kept searching on google and I found a tutorial on how to sculpt models and export it into `three.js`. I showed Kyle and then we realized that this is actually very simple. It is almost similar to exporting an image and making html code to put the image on the website. So me and Kyle began to sculpt our shoe in this website called `vectary`. However, as we were making the shoe on that website, things weren´t as simple as we thought it would be. First, we didn´t know how to sculpt one shape so we had to add multiple shapes together to form it into a shoe, and second, we didn´t know how to add colors to the object. Since we had to use multiple shapes and put them together, the website got slower and slower from rendering so many shapes. This meant that going back to make the shoe more detailed would be impossible. So once me and Kyle came up with the final sculpture we had to put it into three.js. So we had to go back to google and figure out how to export the model. We cam across this thing called a GTLF loader. The GTLF loader is a type of load that basically loads the the model into three.js. Once we figured out how to add a GTLF loader into our ide we were able to successfully export our shoe model. Then we used the documentation again to make the object orbit around in the preview and that is what became our Freedom Project.  

### EDP
Me and Kyle worked very hard for the past month to get our model imported into `three.js`. Now that we had it done, all we had to do was make the shoe more detailed. 
Everyday Me and Kyle tried to keep adding more edits to the model to make the model look more like a shoe. Eventually we kept making so many edits that our vectary stopped loading so we 
we stuck with that final product. That was the model we used for our Freedom Project. 
Also we had to use our knowledge on Javascript to help us use `three.js`. We had to learn how to make the shoe orbit. It was pretty simple. All you had to do is use `model.rotation` and set it to a certain number. Also we coded lighting to our scene to make the visuals look more polished. 


### Skill
The skills that me and Kyle got to work on was mainly presentation. Since we had an SEP expo in the school and an actual presentation for our project in class me and Kyle had to find ways to 
help people understand why we made what we made. The reason why this was difficult for us is because based on our feedback from the judges in the expo rated the enjoyment of our project a 2/4. This made me and Kyle realize 
that during out presentation we have to make it more presentable and fun for the audience and also explaining the bigger picture behind our project as well. 

### Takeaways 
Now that this is the end of our project I can finally talk about all my takeaways throughout the year.
