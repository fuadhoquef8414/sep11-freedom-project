### Content
Our Freedom Project has finally come to a closing. This freedom project came with a lot of learning experiences and trail and error. This year Me and Kyle 
decided to use three.js to make a model of a shoe. This was a very important project to us both because we both are very passionate about shoes and Kyle is a
sneaker reseller. Not only was this just a passion for us, we used techniques to help make our project entertaining for the audience. For our project we wanted to 
use a real world event that is happening right now, in our case our project tackles the trend of sneaker reselling. For our project we decided to create an ad of the shoe.
We thought that a shoe advertisement would be very helpful for the sneaker reseller business. 

### EDP
Me and Kyle worked very hard for the past month to get our model imported into `three.js`. Now that we had it done, all we had to do was make the shoe more detailed. 
Everyday Me and Kyle tried to keep adding more edits to the model to make the model look more like a shoe. Eventually we kept making so many edits that our vectary stopped loading so we 
we stuck with that final product. That was the model we used for our Freedom Project. 

### Skill
The skills that me and Kyle got to work on was mainly presentation. Since we had an SEP expo in the school and an actual presentation for our project in class me and Kyle had to find ways to 
help people understand why we made what we made. The reason why this was difficult for us is because based on our feedback from the judges in the expo rated the enjoyment of our project a 2/4. This made me and Kyle realize 
that during out presentation we have to make it more presentable and fun for the audience and also explaining the bigger picture behind our project as well. 

### Takeaways 
Now that this is the end of our project I can finally talk about all my takeaways throughout the year.
