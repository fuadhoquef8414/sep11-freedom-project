### Purpose
The purpose of the Freedom Project is to use the coding laguage javascript to make a year long project on anything. Me and my partner Kyle are working on using 
javascript to create a 3d model of a sneaker. This is a positive impact on the world because this is a visual of an object for people to look at. It is similar to how there are 
visual lights in time square, those lights a billboards in time square are very nice to look at and we are trying to create visuals for an object that people use everyday. This would be a social 
impact on society because of that reason. 

### Content
Me and my partner Kyle worked figuring out how to add `threejs` to our terminal. This part was very complicated and took us a month to figure out. If you watch a basic tutorial on how to make a shape using `threejs` it will tell you how to code 
the shape. However, the problem right now isn't how to make the shape, the problem is how to set up `threejs` in our terminal. At first we tried to add the `threejs` file to our terminal but it was too big and it wouldn't let us write down any code because the file itself
was too big. So then we had to use this thing called a `cdn`. 

#### What is a CDN
Since the `threejs` file was too big for the ide, it wouldn't let me and Kyle type on the `html` and `script.js` file. So we have to put the file in this thing called a cdn. This cdn is basically a separate server that holds 
large files and keeps in there because your local ide can't hold on to big files. It is a similar concept to how in google photos your pictures save in the cloud so it doesn't take up your phone storage. 

### Next Step
Now that we know how to set up our ide to being linked with `three.js` we could actually start learning about how to set 3d model using `javascript` and during our learning process we could start to code and explore. 
We were stuck for a while trying to understand how to set up but now that we know we could finally get to work.

### Our Build
We finally build a 3d cube that rotates. This took us a while to figure out but it was fairly simple. The three.js documentation actually walekd us through the code but here is the code on how to make a rotation cube.
