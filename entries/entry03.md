# Entry 3
##### 2/7/22

### Context:
This month me and Kyle actualy learned a tremendous amount of things about threejs and many more things about coding. After using the documentation to be able to link threejs to our ide we were able to create a basic 3 shape and set a color for it. We learned about how to put
color on our shapes. Also we learned how to make the shapes moves using the x,y, and z coordinates. We are now starting to learn how to make more complex shapes now because our main objective is to create a visual of a shoe. 

### Next Step
As repeated before the next step for me and Kyle was to learn how to make more complex shapes. The way we are going to do this is on a website called `vectary`. This website allows you to 3d model shapes into certain objects. We currently don't know how to put it into our ide yet but using `vectary` you could build any 3d model you want.
We are currently learning how to use `vectary` becuase there are many mechanics to it that are similar to something like `photoshop` and `blender`. 

### Sources
* We followed a basic tutorial on youtube on how to 3d model for three.js and the video on how to 3d model on `vectary` came up.
* The website `vectary` was another sources because it will help us 3d model shapes and put it into three.js easily.

### EDP
The design process is mainly learning right now while building. Me and Kyle are currently working on learning the tools to sculpt and model certain object. Currently we know who to change height and width of shapes and how to bend the shapes so the shapes have curves. Also `vectary` has a variety of shapes to work with so we are curently trying to experiment with
which shapes would be best with creating a shoe. We will be beginning to model the shoe and our first part that we will be modeling in the shoe is the sole of the shoe and we will most likely use a rectangle shape for it and adjust it so it looks jsut like a sole of a real shoe.

### Skill
Throughout the whole process me and Kyle developed a lot of skills. We learned how a `cdn` works. We learned how to changed colors in `js`. Currently our new skills that we learned is definitely understand the x, y, and z access and how to model and sculpt shapes in `vectary`. We still have more to learn.
