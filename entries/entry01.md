### Purpose
The purpose of the Freedom Project is to use the coding laguage javascript to make a year long project on anything. Me and my partner Kyle are working on using 
javascript to create a 3d model of a sneaker. This is a positive impact on the world because this is a visual of an object for people to look at. It is similar to how there are 
visual lights in time square, those lights a billboards in time square are very nice to look at and we are trying to create visuals for an object that people use everyday. This would be a social 
impact on society because of that reason. 

### Content
* In order to model a 3d sneaker me and Kyle decided to use the tool called three.js. We used this because this tool is very simple and it looks like they focus on building engines
 to make 3d visuals that move which is important because our model is not going to be still. 

* Me and Kyle are going to model a sneaker and we will make it rotate around so people can see the visuals and the detail in each area of the shoe model.
