# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Fuad Farhan

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about using Javascript to make something for the real world. The purpose of this blog is to record and journal the whole process of making my Freedom Project throughout
the year.

## Content
For my project, me and my partner Kyle are making a 3d visual model of a shoe. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying on how to make 3d models using javascript in order to make the 3d model of the sneaker.

## Implications
For our Shoe model we have to take into consideration on the impact of this project. It is important to analyze how our project is impacting the world globally, economically, and socially. Our shoe model can impact the world globally 
but more specifically it impacts the environment. Our shoe model helps the environment because now that there is a digital way of making shoes, there is no need to waste materials to build an actually shoe for the purpose of advertising it. 
Our project is also very helpful economically and more specifically it helps with jobs. It can make people get jobs as resellers since our freedom project was mainly focused on advertising shoes to help resellers. Also since the NFT business is very
popular right now, it is possible for 3d models to become NFTs and it could be helpful with starting business and making money. Our shoe model definitely has a social imapact like cultural impacts because overtime shoes has been apart of culture
for a very long time. The differences in shoe designs come for culture and thats why not all shoes look the same. Overall our Freedom Project was able to have a great impact in a variety of different subcategories of Global, Social, Economic impacts. However, the only downside of our project also known
as the cons is that people might not be used to digital version of shoes or they might not want to let go of the modern way of seeing interest in shoes such as seeing it in a display case or getting to hold it and look at it for themselves because obvious you sense of touch is limited when you are looking at someone digitally.
